# Getting Support
Voicemail Express 3 is a solution designed, developed, and maintained by Amazon Connect SAs. While great effort has been spent to validate its use and effectiveness, it is not an AWS service or product, is not aligned to any AWS Service Team, and support is at a best effort with the resources available. There are, however, three primary pathways to support:

1. Using the [Issues](https://github.com/amazon-connect/voicemail-express-amazon-connect/issues) feature of this repository for defects, errors, or deployment issues. Any issues posted here are routed to the team that maintains Voicemail Express 3, and has the most direct hands-on knowledge. Additionally, any previously raised issues are archived and explained for future reference to help other users in their troubleshooting efforts. No AWS support plan is required for this.
2. Using the [Discussions](https://github.com/amazon-connect/voicemail-express-amazon-connect/discussions) feature of this repository for feature requests, general use questions, modification guidance, etc. As with the Issues section, no AWS support plan is required for this.
3. [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support). You can open an AWS Support case as well. You will need to insure that the case is opened against this solution's repository to be properly routed to this team. You must have an AWS support plan to open a case.
